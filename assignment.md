# Python Assignment


## Part 0: Fork and clone the repo

You should make your own copy of the repository so that you can edit it and at the end submit a pull request.

1. Create a fork of this repo by clicking on the **Fork** link in the upper right.
2. Checkout your personal copy of the repo: `git clone https://github.com/<username>/python-intro1`

### How to submit?
1. `git add filename` (or `git add .`) for all the files you want to add.
2. `git commit -m "Message describing what you did"`
3. `git push origin master`
4. Now if you go to your personal copy on github, your changes should be there: `https://github.com/<username>/python-intro1`
5. From there, click on **Pull Requests** and then **New pull request**.

Ideally, you should regularly run steps 1-3. This will save your work as you go. And if you ever goof things up, you will have all the history, you can revert any file to how it was at any previous commit!

## Assignments 
1. Write a program to prompt the user for English score and Math score using input to compute total score and average score. Use 95 for English and 85 for Math to test the program (the total and the average should be 180 and 90 respectively). You should use input to read a string and int() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking or bad user data.
Using atom text editor, open ./src/assignment_2.1.py and write your program.
<br>Compare your output with 'Desired Output'

    Desired Output:<br> 
        <b>Total Score: 180</b><br>
        <b>Average Score: 90.0</b>
                 
2.1. Write a program to prompt the user for English score and Math score using input to compute total score and average score. Give English score 1.5 times for scores above 80. 
Use 95 for English and 85 for Math to test the program (the total and the weighted average should be 187.5 and 93.75 respectively). You should use input to read a string and int() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking the user input - assume the user types numbers properly.
Using atom text editor, open ./src/assignment_2.2.1.py and write your program.
<br>Compare your output with 'Desired Output'
 

    Desired Output: 
            Total Score: 187.5
            Average Score: 93.75

2.2 Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
    Score Grade
    '>= 0.9 A
    '>= 0.8 B
    '>= 0.7 C
    '>= 0.6 D
    < 0.6 F
If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit. For the test, enter a score of 0.85.            

Using atom text editor, open ./src/assignment_2.2.2.py and write your program.
<br>Compare your output with 'Desired Output'

    Desired Output: 
            B


3. Write a program to prompt the user for English score and Math score using input to compute total score or average score. Give English score 1.5 times for scores above 80. Put the logic to do the computation of the scores in a function called <b>compute_total_average()</b> and use the function to do the computation. The function should return a value, total score or average score depending on the argument assigned to the parameter, 'stat'. Use 95 for English and 85 for Math to test the program . You should use <b>input</b> to read a string and <b>int()</b> to convert the string to a number. Do not name your variable sum or use the sum() function.
And then submit it as above submit guide. 

Using atom text editor, open ./src/assignment_2.3.py and write your program.
<br>Compare your output with 'Desired Output'

    Desired Output: 
            Total Score: 187.5
            Average Score: 93.75
