<b>composition</b> Using an expression as part of a larger expression, or a statement as part of a larger statement.
<b>deterministic</b> Pertaining to a program that does the same thing each time it runs, given the same inputs.
<b>dot notation</b> The syntax for calling a function in another module by specifying the module name followed by a dot (period) and the function name.
<b>flow of execution</b> The order in which statements are executed during a program run.
<b>fruitful function</b> A function that returns a value.
